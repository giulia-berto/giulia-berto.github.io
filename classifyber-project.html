							<h1>White matter fiber classification</h1>
							<p>The aim of this project was to build a <b>classifier</b> able to classify 
								white matter fibers into anatomically meaningful white matter tracts 
								of the human brain. </p>
							<p>Obtaining accurately segmented white matter tracts in the human brain is essential for
								multiple applications, such as pre-surgical planning and tractometry. Although notable 
								improvements have occurred over the years, the segmentation quality is not yet satisfactory, 
								especially when dealing with datasets with diverse characteristics, such as different 
								tract properties, tracking methods, or data quality. To overcome these limitations, 
								we proposed a novel supervised segmentation method, called Classifyber, which combines 
								in a simple linear model information from the geometry of the fiber paths, from their 
								connectivity patterns, and from anatomy.</p>
							<p>Classifyber is a <b>supervised method</b> that performs <b>automatic tract segmentation</b> by learning
								from example tracts segmented by experts. In particular, Classifyber provides a <b>linear 
								classifier</b> that accurately predicts whether or not a given streamline (i.e. fiber) belongs 
								to the tract of interest. In order to create the linear classifier, first we
								transform each streamline into a vector that contains both its geometrical and anatomical
								information. Then, we train a linear classifier, specifically Logistic Regression, with such
								vectors from multiple participants in which experts segmented the tracts of interest.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ohbm2020_poster_Giulia_Berto_img4.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>We ran multiple experiments over four different datasets, and compared the performances of 
								our method, Classifyber, with other three state-of-the-art- tract segmentation methods through
								the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score (the higher the better). Classifyber outperformed 
								the other methods in all cases, and	segmented the tracts very accurately. This occured across 
								different kinds of tracts, tractography techniques, expert-made segmentations, and data
								quality. Classifyber is	freely available as an <b>open source web app</b> through the platorm 
								brainlife.io.</p>
