							<h1>White Matter tract segmentation</h1>
							<p> This project aimed at <b>automatically segment</b> white matter tract in the human brain by considering both anatomy and
								geometry of the tracts.</p>
							<p>Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) can provide a virtual representation of the paths of millions
								of fibers composing the brain white matter. The aim of white matter tract segmentation is to group together fibers that share a similar pathway
								into anatomically meaningful structures, called tracts, which are of interest for several applications, such as
								surgical planning and tractometry analyses.<br>
							Current methods for automatic tract segmentation consider either only prior knowledge about the
								geometrical properties of a tract, or only its relative anatomical
								position. To overcome this limitation, we extended a state-of-the-art
								fiber-based method based on the <b>Linear Assignment Problem</b> (LAP) by taking into account
								information about both the geometry of the tracts and the underlying anatomy at the same time.</p>
							<p>The LAP method performs automatic tract segmentation by
								exploiting the concept of fiber correspondence across subjects. Given a set of previously segmented
								tracts as examples, the method aims to find the same tract in a new target subject by solving a
								<b>combinatorial optimization problem</b>. To include prior anatomical
								information within the optimization process, we proposed to linearly combine the distance matrix (i.e. the original cost matrix) with other two
								anatomically-informed matrices: the endpoint-based distance matrix and the Region of Interest (ROI)-based distance matrix.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lap-anat-image.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>We ran multiple experiments with multiple examples using
								the LAP method (multi-LAP) and the proposed method (multi-LAP-anat) to segment 6 large tracts and 6 small tracts. We then compared their performances through the Dice 
								Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score, which measures the degree of overlap with the ground truth tract (the higher the better). The proposed multi-LAP-anat method outperforms 
								the multi-LAP method for all the bundles considered. Higher improvements were obtained in particular for smaller bundles.</p>
